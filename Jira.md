## How Atlassian HR solved its data problem using Jira

Look under the hood of any modern company’s team and you’ll find the steady hum of technology, teamwork, and operations in the pursuit of growth. Atlassian is no different. 

The company recently set a goal of reaching 25,000 employees by 2025. That’s triple the number of current employees at the company and has big implications for the people systems that underpin it.

“It’s an incredible goal that needs an incredible platform across the company, including on the People technology side,” says Caroline McBride, a senior business systems analyst on Atlassian’s People Tech team.

Atlassian’s HR department is called the People team. They’re supported by the People Tech team – an Atlassian IT group dedicated to developing IT solutions to support the needs of HR. It’s a model that’s essential to how Atlassian HR operates and grows with the overall company.

Without a platform to support a scaling organization, there’s a lot of unnecessary effort spent tracking and updating systems that could easily be tracked through automation instead of continuing to do it manually. It’s how Caroline and Atlassian’s People Tech team solved a problem plaguing HR for years.
